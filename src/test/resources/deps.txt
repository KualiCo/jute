- ability to create JIRA sub-tasks

- workflow ingestion automation
-- i've modified Rice's poller impl such that it can load things from the classpath in addition to the file system

- directory structure design
-- do this in a way that transparently provides for the ability to manage that as an application runtime concern vs a build process concern

- ide metadata
- bump Guava to 18.0


- commented out the Oracle jdbc driver?
- walk through creating a sub-task in Jira
- review scopes on pom.xml (is rice-*-impl) scoped as anything but runtime?

Please accept this email as my formal resignation of the position of "Engineer" at KualiCo effective March 31, 2015.
